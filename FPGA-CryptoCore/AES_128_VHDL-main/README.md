# VHDL-CryptoCore-128: High-Performance AES-128 Hardware Engine




**CryptoCore-128** is a robust, high-throughput hardware implementation of the **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** with a 128-bit key length. Designed specifically for **FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array)** deployment, this VHDL engine provides hardware-level isolation and deterministic performance, making it ideal for securing sensitive real-time data streams where software encryption would be too slow.

The system is managed by a sophisticated **Finite State Machine (FSM)** known as , ensuring seamless coordination between key generation, data buffering, and the core cryptographic transformation rounds.



Our mission was to develop a hardware security module capable of protecting data in modern autonomous systems:
* **Real-Time Encryption:** Achieving low-latency processing to secure continuous data flows (e.g., Drone-to-Ground communication).
* **Hardware-Based Security:** Offloading cryptographic tasks from the CPU to a dedicated, tamper-resistant FPGA fabric.
* **Autonomous Key Management:** Integrating a **CSPRNG** (Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator) for internal, secure key rotation.



##  System Architecture
The architecture is modular, facilitating independent verification of each component before final integration into the `AES_Core`.

### 1. The Control Unit (FSM Orchestrator)
The FSM acts as the "Logical Brain" of the system, managing transitions through critical states:
* **IDLE:** Power-saving mode, waiting for the `System_START` signal.
* **KEY_GEN:** Interfacing with the **CSPRNG** to prepare a fresh 128-bit key.
* **ENCRYPT:** Executing the 10 transformation rounds of the AES algorithm.
* **STREAMING:** Coordinating the data pipeline between Input and Output FIFOs for continuous operation.

### 2. The Data Path (AES Engine)
 The data path includes:
* **Key Expansion:** An internal logic block that derives 11 round keys from the initial seed.
* **Core Transformations:** Optimized VHDL entities for `SubBytes` (S-Box), `ShiftRows`, `MixColumns`, and `AddRoundKey`.
* **Galois Field Math:** Efficient hardware multiplication in $GF(2^8)$ to minimize resource utilization.

### 3. Key Management (CSPRNG)
The engine includes a dedicated generator providing high entropy keys, ensuring that the encryption remains unpredictable and robust against cryptanalysis.



##  Simulation & Verification
The design was tested using **ModelSim** to ensure 100% functional accuracy.

* **Logic Verification:** Simulation waveforms confirm perfect state transitions from `RUN` to `DONE_STATE`.
* **Timing Analysis:** Validated `key_valid` and `ciphertext_ready` signals to guarantee synchronization.
* **Hexadecimal Accuracy:** Output ciphertexts were verified against official NIST test vectors.
